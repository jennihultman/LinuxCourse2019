# LinuxCourse2019
## Introduction

Most high-throughput bioinformatics tasks these days take place on the Unix environment and the most important software are designed to work best when used with a command-line interface. Because the command line can be an intimidating environment, many biologists tends to avoid it and limit their work on available web-based tools or local installation of software with graphic user interface. This means that they miss out the opportunity to access e.g. cloud computing or advance supercomputing which might help them to perform much more interesting analyses. 
The best way to learn how to work in Unix command line environment is to be challenged in real problems trying to resolve them using “Trial and error” method through a self-learning process. Indeed, the Unix users form a very large community and the majority of the solutions are already available online in the web. This course is, therefore, designed to stimulate self and peer-learning using a set of very well designed and realistic bioinformatics problems typically occurring in the life of a biologist. The student will have access to 4 problems posted in a dedicated github account and one month to resolve them. 

## Target group
This course is targeted at PhD and MSc students who are interested in learning how to work in Unix command line environment. NB! This course is mandatory for whom is willing to attend to the course "Metagenomics" held in May 2019. 

## Learning outcomes
By the end of the course students will have the confidence to navigate throughout the Unix command line environment and to find online solutions for handling basic bioinformatics problems. 

## Schedule
The students should start with the tasks immediately. On 23rd of April there will be a 2 hours introduction and some tips on how to tackle the problems. During the introduction students will learn how to access CSC supercomputing clusters through the command line and how to perform locally a blast job (two requisites for the course). The student will work alone or in groups (if they wish) for the next month to try to resolve the problems. 
- April 10th Course page opens and students can start the course 
- 10th of April 2019 Course page opens and students can start the course 
- 23rd of April 2019	Tutorial	Mandatory
- 9th of May 2019	Submission of the exams to the teachers	Mandatory
- 17th of May 2019	Feedback	Optional

## Exam and feedback
By 9th of May each student should submit online to the teacher (instruction during the tutorial day) the solutions of the problems. Student will pass the exam if they will answer correctly at least 50% (45 out of 60 points) of the problems and questions. The teachers will give the final results in one weeks. If the student is interested on 17th of May there will be a session where the teachers will give feedback to the students on the solutions of the problems.
